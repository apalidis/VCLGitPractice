If it's your first time here, congrats! We'll start you off with a simple task to get familiar with our system.

# Practice Task

Start by making a change to this repo. It doesn't really matter what change you make, so just add a text file with your favourite animal as the name and then add your name to the readme file. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/UBC-VCL/VCLFramework/wiki/Git-Instructions) and get one of the senior people to sign off on the change once you're done.

==============================

This is a practice Repo for VCL Members to play around with git.
